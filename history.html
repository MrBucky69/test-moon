            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was the first President of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. Washington played a key role in the American Revolution and is often referred to as the "Father of His Country." He led the Continental Army to victory over the British during the Revolutionary War, and later presided over the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which established the framework for the new federal government. Throughout his life, Washington was known for his leadership, integrity, and dedication to the principles of liberty and democracy.

            <p>
                George Washington was born into a wealthy Virginia family and received a basic education at home. At the age of 16, he began working as a surveyor, a profession that would take him into the wilderness of Virginia and help shape his understanding of the land and its people. In 1751, Washington's older half-brother, Lawrence, died, leaving him Mount Vernon, the family estate. This inheritance marked the beginning of Washington's transition into the role of a Virginia plantation owner and set the stage for his entry into public life.
